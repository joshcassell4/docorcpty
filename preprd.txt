I want to make a PRD.md file for an application that uses python running in a container to orchestrate containers running different terminal applications such as coding tools, ascii-based games, common terminal commands, etc. It should use pexpect and dockerpty (if applicable) to spawn and connect to the containers. It should use json for configuration. It should have a number of samples to demonstrate spawning containers and sending commands and parsing the outputs. I want to orchestrate some common containers and need dockerfiles to create the images for the orchestrator container. The orchestrator containers needs to have a python development environment and mapped volumes for the docker.sock and the development directory. I want to be able to have a dashboard that allows me to control the containers and interact with them. I need it to be easy to use. Please add any other considerations to the PRD that I might have missed. There should be a .gitignore file for the project and I need a SETUP.md file for setting it up and a README.md file for the repository. I only want the PRD.md file at this time and any other points I might have missed.
